# Post-Payment Flow Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to implement the post-payment flow after a successful payment with Razorpay in the Learnzy Pathway application.

## 1. Payment Success Page

Created a dedicated `PaymentSuccess.tsx` page that:

- Shows a confirmation message with a checkmark
- Displays what was unlocked (all cycles)
- Provides clear next steps (buttons to dashboard or to start learning)
- Handles edge cases like users trying to access the page directly
- Uses sessionStorage to track if they just completed a payment

## 2. GlobalPaymentContext Updates

Enhanced the GlobalPaymentContext to:

- Add a refreshPaymentStatus function to recheck payment status when needed
- Navigate to the success page after successful payment
- Set flags in sessionStorage to verify the payment flow
- Expose hasPaid status to components that need it

## 3. Locked Cycles UI

Updated UI components to properly handle locked vs. unlocked states:

- Modified `CycleCard.tsx` to show a lock overlay on locked cycles
- Added a consistent visual style for locked content
- Set cycle 1 as always free, with cycles 2+ requiring payment

## 4. Mock Test Access Control

Implemented payment-gated access to mock tests:

- Updated `PreMockTest.tsx` to show a lock message with payment button
- Checks cycle number against payment status to determine access
- Provides a clear upgrade path via UnlockAllButton

## 5. usePayment Hook Refactoring

Refactored the `usePayment.ts` hook to:

- Use the global payment system instead of per-cycle payments
- Update all mock tests' lock status based on payment state
- Handle unlocking all cycles when payment is successful
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

## 6. Dashboard Integration

Added payment prompts to the dashboard:

- Integrated UnlockAllButton in DashboardHeader
- Shows button only for users who haven't paid
- Provides an easy upgrade path from the main dashboard

## 7. Route Configuration

Added the new PaymentSuccess route to App.tsx:

- Protected the route to require authentication
- Ensured proper navigation to and from the success page

## 8. Test Structure

Ensured test assignments are unlocked when payment is verified:

- Used the GlobalPaymentProvider to track payment status
- Applied the lock/unlock logic consistently across the app
- Considered cycle 1 as a "free sample" with no payment needed

## 9. Additional Considerations

- Made the price visible (â‚¹2000) on the unlock button
- Used Supabase RLS policies to protect content at the database level
- Redirected appropriately based on payment status
- Added clear visual indicators of locked vs. unlocked content

---

This implementation provides a seamless payment experience where users are guided through payment, shown a clear confirmation, and then have immediate access to all mock tests and cycles they've paid for. The system is also designed to be maintainable and easily extended in the future.
