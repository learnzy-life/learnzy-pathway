# Supabase Integration Guidelines

This application uses Supabase for backend services. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Project Information**
   - Project ID: duvqdpyxrkdmoyizepqv
   - Always use this project ID for Supabase access

2. **Database Access**
   - All database operations should be in service files
   - Keep database logic separate from UI components
   - Use typed responses from Supabase queries
   - Handle errors appropriately

3. **Authentication**
   - Use Supabase Auth for user authentication
   - Protect sensitive routes with [src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx](mdc:src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx)
   - Handle auth state changes properly

4. **Storage**
   - Use Supabase Storage for file uploads
   - Follow bucket naming conventions
   - Set proper security rules for buckets

5. **Edge Functions**
   - Serverless functions should be in [supabase/functions/](mdc:supabase/functions)
   - Keep functions small and focused

6. **Migrations**
   - Database schema changes should be tracked properly
   - Use migration files when applicable

7. **Security**
   - Never expose sensitive credentials in client-side code
   - Use Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
   - Follow least privilege principle

When working with Supabase, follow these patterns to ensure consistent and secure data access.
