# Component Guidelines

Components should follow these guidelines:

1. Components should be UI-only. They should not contain business logic.
2. Business logic should be extracted to hooks or services.
3. Use TypeScript for type safety. Define proper prop types for each component.
4. Components should be organized by feature or domain.
5. Use the UI components from [src/components/ui/](mdc:src/components/ui) for consistent styling.
6. For layouts and complex UI, reference existing components like [src/components/Header.tsx](mdc:src/components/Header.tsx).
7. Follow the established naming conventions (PascalCase for components).
8. Components should be composition-friendly and reusable when possible.
9. For responsive design, use the `use-mobile` hook: [src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx](mdc:src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx).
10. Use the Shadcn UI component system as configured in [components.json](mdc:components.json).

When creating new components, keep them focused, maintainable, and consistent with the existing codebase.
